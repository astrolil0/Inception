## What is Docker?

Docker is a platform for running software applications portably and reliably across systems. Docker packages applications and their dependencies in lightweight, portable and self-sufficient execution environments called “containers”. This ensures that your application runs the same way everywhere: on the developer PC, in a test environment, and in production.

is a platform for packaging, deploying and running software applications in containers.
A container contains all the components necessary for the application to run
is a containerization platform.





#### What is a container
One of the main advantages of containers is that they are lightweight and portable. 
A container contains all the components necessary for the application to work
The containers are isolated from each other and from the main system, making them portable and easy to deploy in different environments.




#### What is image 
The working version of the image is called a container 
Images are defined through text files, usually called Dockerfiles 
It forms the basis of Docker containers and provides all the files and settings needed to initialize a container
Each image is identified by a unique ID, which enables storage and sharing of the Docker image.
If the image server is hacked, it also affects the 2nd application
