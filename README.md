## What is Docker?

Docker is a platform for running software applications portably and reliably across systems. Docker packages applications and their dependencies in lightweight, portable and self-sufficient execution environments called “containers”. This ensures that your application runs the same way everywhere: on the developer PC, in a test environment, and in production.
